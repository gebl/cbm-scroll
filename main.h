/**
 * The first important thing is that the VICII can only adress 16k ram at once.
 * This means that the 64k memory is divided into four 16k VIC banks. $DD00's
 * lowmost 2 bits controls that which bank is seen by the VIC:
 *
 * $DD00 = %xxxxxx11 -> bank0: $0000-$3fff
 * $DD00 = %xxxxxx10 -> bank1: $4000-$7fff
 * $DD00 = %xxxxxx01 -> bank2: $8000-$bfff
 * $DD00 = %xxxxxx00 -> bank3: $c000-$ffff
 *
 * If speed is not critical its generally a good idea to change vic bank like
 * this:
 *
 * lda $DD00
 * and #%11111100
 * ora #%000000xx ;<- your desired VIC bank value, see above
 * sta $DD00
 *
 * These are controlled by $D018.
 * The Screen dimensions are 40Ã—25 = 1000 bytes of data. When telling the C64
 * where you want to put your screen data, this is rounded up to 1024 = $400, so
 * you can put screen data on each multiple of $400 bytes in memory. $0400,
 * $0800, $0c00, $1000, $1400, and so on.
 *
 * Char mem is made up of 256x8 byte chars: 256*8= 2048 -> $0800
 * Bitmap is (40x8)x25 = 8000, rounded up to 8192 -> $2000

 * Sprites
 * Sprites read their data based on the value of their corresponding Sprite Pointer. Sprite Pointers are located always at the _given_ screen memory's last 8 bytes. ie: screen_memory+$03f8 = sprite pointer0. As everything sprite adresses are also _relative_ to the start of the VIC bank.
 * 
 * for dummies:
 * screen_memory_start+$03f8 = sprite pointer0
 * screen_memory_start+$03f9 = sprite pointer1
 * screen_memory_start+$03fa = sprite pointer2
 * screen_memory_start+$03fb = sprite pointer3
 * screen_memory_start+$03fc = sprite pointer4
 * screen_memory_start+$03fd = sprite pointer5
 * screen_memory_start+$03fe = sprite pointer6
 * screen_memory_start+$03ff = sprite pointer7
